Attempting to get slate and inferno to work together

localStorage.debug = 'slate:*'

Just trying to register a simple editor. Everything behaves the way it does when using react to render, including updating the dom, except that the final render never fires, it seems as if the leaf constructor is never invoked.

Hoping someone could look at the problem, and point me in a new direction.
